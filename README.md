## Overview

Basically, we will be working on building a front & back end server. I am on charge of the back end and kevin will be working on the front end.

## Getting Started

I watched today zoom lab to follow the steps.
I first, I created my server.js and install node, express, mongoose, cors and dotenv. I use the starter code to build my server. I then, created 2 files.
The first one is the 'book.js' and 'seed.js'
I then use my mongodb address to set it up.

Logistical
I will be available anytime during class hours and late at night as well. Slack will be my best communication method during this week. I will be taking a 10 minutes break every hour to refresh my mind. If we start falling behind, I will be working extra hours to catch up.

Cooperative
I found out that I am kind of good in back-end server setting and debugging. I will be using my strenght to help my teammate to overcome challenges. Kevin is familiar with the front-end server and I will be learning from him as well. Our day to day development will be base on what we have to accomplish. We will have to be flexible and understand each others.

Conflict Resolution
We will have a conversation and be fair. It is important fo each one of us to knw our responsabilty and be mindfull. Communication will be a key to approach challenges and building the application.
