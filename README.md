## Overview

Basically, we will be working on building a front & back end server. I am on charge of the back end and kevin will be working on the front end.

## Getting Started

I watched today zoom lab to follow the steps.
I first, I created my server.js and install node, express, mongoose, cors and dotenv. I use the starter code to build my server. I then, created 2 files.
The first one is the 'book.js' and 'seed.js'
I then use my mongodb address to set it up.
